# Route-Optimization-and-Delivery-Management-System

The **Route Optimization and Delivery Management System** is a Java application designed to facilitate route optimization and data processing for delivery management tasks. This graphical user interface (GUI) provides easy access to essential functionalities such as optimizing delivery routes using Dijkstra's algorithm and processing delivery data through sorting algorithms.

## Features

- **Optimize Route**: Initiate route optimization using Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between locations.
- **Process Data**: Perform data processing tasks such as sorting delivery data in ascending order.

## Installation

To run the Delivery Management System GUI, ensure you have Java installed on your system. Simply compile and execute the `DeliveryManagementSystemGUI.java` file.

```bash
javac DeliveryManagementSystemGUI.java
java DeliveryManagementSystemGUI
```

## Usage

Upon launching the application, you will be presented with a window containing two main buttons:

- **Optimize Route**: Clicking this button triggers Dijkstra's algorithm simulation for route optimization. You will be prompted to enter the graph data in the format `A-B:1,B-C:2`.
- **Process Data**: Clicking this button initiates a sorting algorithm simulation for processing delivery data. You will be prompted to enter numbers to sort in the format `3,1,2,5,4`.

### Example Inputs for Dijkstra's Algorithm

1. **Simple Graph**
   - Input: `A-B:1,B-C:2,C-D:3`
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     A to A: 0
     A to B: 1
     A to C: 3
     A to D: 6
     ```

2. **Graph with Multiple Paths**
   - Input: `A-B:1,A-C:4,B-C:2,C-D:1,B-D:5`
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     A to A: 0
     A to B: 1
     A to C: 3
     A to D: 4
     ```

3. **Graph with a Direct Path**
   - Input: `A-B:10,A-C:3,C-B:1,B-D:2,C-D:8`
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     A to A: 0
     A to B: 4
     A to C: 3
     A to D: 6
     ```

### Example Input for Sorting Algorithm

- **Input**: `3,1,2,5,4`
- **Expected Output**: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
