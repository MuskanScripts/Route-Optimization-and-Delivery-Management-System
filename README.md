Delivery Management System GUI
The Delivery Management System GUI is a Java application designed to facilitate route optimization and data processing for delivery management tasks. This graphical user interface provides easy access to essential functionalities such as optimizing delivery routes using Dijkstra's algorithm and processing delivery data through sorting algorithms.

Features
Optimize Route: Initiate route optimization using Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between locations.
Process Data: Perform data processing tasks such as sorting delivery data in ascending order.
Installation
To run the Delivery Management System GUI, ensure you have Java installed on your system. Follow these steps to compile and execute the DeliveryManagementSystemGUI.java file:

bash
Copy code
javac DeliveryManagementSystemGUI.java
java DeliveryManagementSystemGUI
Usage
Upon launching the application, you will be presented with a window containing two main buttons:

Optimize Route: Clicking this button triggers Dijkstra's algorithm simulation for route optimization.
Process Data: Clicking this button initiates a sorting algorithm simulation for processing delivery data.
